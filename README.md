I took a slightly different approach to Worms3D but kept the same core mechanics.

I focused on creating a smooth movement and camera system with a couple small satisfying UI elements.
I aimed for the VG grade with the following criteria:

- (VG, small) Add main menu (start) scene and game over scene
- (VG, small) A worm can only move a certain range
- (VG, small) Camera movement

The current version of the game is very minimalistic but is able to scale. However, there are no instructions on how to play included in the game itself, 
so they will be listed here.

Instructions:

Each player controls one character. Use WASD to move and Spacebar to jump. Holding RMB will put you into aiming mode where you are able to click LMB to fire
off a projectile. Each player can fire once per turn. Each player has a stamina bar that will drain when moving or jumping. When you run out of stamina you 
can no longer move, but you are still able to fire your weapon. When your turn is complete, you can pass the turn by pressing R at any time. Win the game by
hitting your opponent with projectiles until their health depletes.

Controls:
- WASD -- movement
- Spacebar -- jump
- RMB -- aim mode
- LMB -- fire projectile (while in aim mode)
- R -- pass turn
